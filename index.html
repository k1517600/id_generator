            <p>This is the ID Generator that I made for Jordan High School. I will continue to update it every year. My name is Joshua Novak and I made this website in 2022 for a digital arts project. I am going to graduate soon, but this website will still be my child. I will continue to update it until I can do so no longer. I hope you can find it useful.  </p>
            <p>Your information is not saved! I can assure you, I really don't care at all about your information.</p>
            <p>Your information is needed to confirm that you are a Jordan Highschool Student and to access your ID photo.</p>
            <p>Having an issue? Get in touch! My discord is alrightytighty, add me there and I can see what's up.</p>
