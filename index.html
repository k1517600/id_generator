    <title>ID Generator - JHS</title>

</head>




<body>

    <div>

        I know the website doesn't look too fancy, but it works, and that's what matters.

    </div>

    <div>

        This site allows any <b> Jordan High School Student</b> generate an ID that they can print out at home.

        The bar code has been tested to work, so use in the lunch line is perfectly okay.

        I don't save any of your information, it's just used to get your information. Although I might start

        saving information in the future, I will NOT do it without explicit consent and the usage of this tool

        will not be dependant on whether or not you share your information with me.




    </div>

    <div>

        If you are not a JHS student, I'm sorry, but this tool isn't made for you. I don't want any non JHS

        students making JHS IDs, so if you aren't a JHS student, this tool will not work.




    </div>

    <div>

        I would love to in depth explain how the process works, but any information I give is an opporunity

        for the district to patch it. Speaking of which, I am Joshua Novak, 11th grade student. This was made for my

        Digital Arts and Animation "Genius Hour" project, where I took an hour or so each week to work on it. I plan on
        making

        the site prettier, but functionality always comes before aesthetic. Thank you for taking the time to come to the
        site, and

        I hope you can find use in this tool.

        <b>Usage: </b>
        <p>You first put your katyisd ID, then your grade level, then your password. Shoutout to someone named Pranav
            who kept putting in his name to the username field</p>
        <b>Troubleshooting: </b>
        <p>Make sure you can access your ID photo on my katy cloud. Log into my katy and go to the "student id" section.
        </p>
        <p>Make sure your info is correct and make sure you're a JHS student. Again, doesn't work if you're not from
            JHS.</p>
        <p>Try using the ping button to see if my server can be pinged. A response of "Pong!" means that the server was pinged successfully.</p>
    </div>

    <div></div>

    <script>
        function ping() {
            var pingRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();
            pingRequest.open("GET", "https://idgenerator.ngrok.io/ping", false)
            try {
                pingRequest.send()
                var text = document.createElement("p")
                var textNode = document.createTextNode("Pong!")
                text.appendChild(textNode)
                document.body.appendChild(text)
            } catch {
                var text = document.createElement("p")
                var textNode = document.createTextNode("Server couldn't be pinged. My computer's probably offline or something.")
                text.appendChild(textNode)
                document.body.appendChild(text)
            }
