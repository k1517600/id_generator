        I know the website doesn't look too fancy, but it works, and that's what matters.

        This site allows any <b> Jordan High School Student</b> generate an ID that they can print out at home.

        The bar code has been tested to work, so use in the lunch line is perfectly okay.

        I don't save any of your information, it's just used to get your information. Although I might start

        saving information in the future, I will NOT do it without explicit consent and the usage of this tool

        will not be dependant on whether or not you share your information with me.

        If you are not a JHS student, I'm sorry, but this tool isn't made for you. I don't want any non JHS

        students making JHS IDs, so if you aren't a JHS student, this tool will not work.

        I would love to in depth explain how the process works, but any information I give is an opporunity

        for the district to patch it. Speaking of which, I am Joshua Novak, 11th grade student. This was made for my

        Digital Arts and Animation "Genius Hour" project, where I took an hour or so each week to work on it. I plan on making

        the site prettier, but functionality always comes before aesthetic. Thank you for taking the time to come to the site, and

        I hope you can find use in this tool.
